# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Check out the roadmap

We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a *milestone* label available on the issue. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

1. fork the repository to your account and make clone of it.
   - to fork the repository follow this [tutorial.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fork-a-github-repository/)
   - to clone the repository follow this [tutorial.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. add this repository to upstream and run git pull on main branch.
3. create a new branch from main and add your changes to it, commit them with meaningful commit message and open a pull request on this repo.
   - if you don't know all of this, don't worry, follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6b6B9oN4Vg) to know all these things.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.
